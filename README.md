# Tasks
Tasks is command line utility to manage your tasks in terminal.

## Requirements
[fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)        
gcc compiler version 9+

## How to install
```shell
$ ./install.sh  
```
You should be good to go. However, if you are not able to execute it, use       
```shell
$ chmod 700 install.sh  
``` 
This would give read, write, execute permission to current user.

## How to uninstall
```fish
$ $HOME/.local/lib/tasks/./uninstall.sh
```
